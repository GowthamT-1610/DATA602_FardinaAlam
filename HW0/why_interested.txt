I am very interested in studying Data Science in my masterâ€™s program  because I want to dive into the world of Big Data and enhance my skills in data collection techniques. My goal is to learn how to work efficiently with large datasets and gain expertise in Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).By mastering these areas, I aim to find valuable insights and contribute to data-driven decisions.
